## Act One

**Narrator:** A gentle breeze brushes over a lake, pear blossoms fluttering, softly landing on the rippling water. In the deep forest, two figures emerge, their murmurs echoing through the trees. It's a brother and sister who are lost in the woods.

**Brother:** I'm so hungry, and I don't know if there's anything to eat in this forest!

**Sister:** Me too, brother. Let's go find something to eat!

**Brother:** (patting his sister's head)

**Narrator:** At this moment, a dark figure appears in the woods, slowly approaching the siblings.

**Witch:** Children, are you hungry? I have two apples here, you can have them first!

**Narrator:** The siblings hesitate, but the apples emit a faint, tempting fragrance. They accept the apples, thank the witch, take a bite, but after a moment, they start feeling dizzy, their vision blurring, and they collapse.

## Act Two

**Narrator:** The siblings wake up to find themselves lying in a small wooden hut, a cat suddenly appearing in front of them.

**Brother:** Where are we? I only remember eating an apple before I passed out, and then I don't remember anything.

**Cat:** You were captured by the witch in the forest. I tried to escape but was careless and got turned into a cat by her. This time, the witch intends to eat you both.

**Sister:** How terrifying! Kind cat, please help us!

**Cat:** You must run quickly. The witch is out shopping for ingredients as we speak. I have a magic wand here; you can make a wish with it, hopefully, it can help you. Take it and go, and remember to come back and rescue me.

**Narrator:** The siblings thank the cat and promptly flee.

## Act Three

**Narrator:** The siblings are lost in the forest trying to find their way home when they encounter a witch who has just finished shopping for groceries.

**Witch:** Stop right there! (The witch waves her wand.)

**Narrator:** The witch begins conjuring a sea of thorns and brambles to trap the siblings.

**Witch:** Raging waves!

**Siblings:** We wish for a bridge. (They make a wish with the wand.)

**Narrator:** The enraged witch tries to attack them with magic missiles, but she is shot dead by an old hunter who happens to be passing by.

**Siblings:** Thank you for saving us.

**Hunter:** You're welcome.

**Brother:** There's a cabin deep in the woods where someone is waiting for us to rescue them. Can you help us?

**Hunter:** Let's go take a look.

## Act 4

**Narrator:** The group returns to the cabin. On the way, the hunter listens to the whole story. They start looking for a way to turn the cat back into a human. Then the hunter finds a book and inside is a way to turn the cat back into a human.

**Hunter:** Try this!

**Narrator:** The cat is turned back into a human.

**Boy (cat):** Thank you!

**Brother:** You're welcome. You can head home now!

**Hunter:** Let me give you a ride home!

**Everyone:** Yay!
